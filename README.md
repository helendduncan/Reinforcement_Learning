# Reinforcement_Learning
A repo containing my efforts running through the reinforcement learning book by Sutton and Barto
The book can be found [here](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf); other sources include [David Silver's lecture course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ).
My work will be summarised in a static github site [here]( https://helendduncan.github.io/Reinforcement_Learning/).
