# Reinforcement Learning
## Summary

This is a place I use to document my work throught the Reinforcement Learning [book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf) by Sutton and Barto. I am also using it to get more comfortable with publishing pages using GitHub Actions. This documentation repository uses [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org). A static version of this work can be found [here](https://helendduncan.github.io/Reinforcement_Learning/) on the project's github page.
